# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping
## Description
What you should learn from this project:

* Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
* How to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script
* How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
* How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
* What ORM means
* How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table
### 0. Get all states
* Write a script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:
### 1. Filter states
* Write a script that lists all states with a name starting with N (upper N) from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:
### 2. Filter states by user input
* Write a script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name matches the argument.
### 3. SQL Injection...
* Wait, do you remember the previous task? Did you test "Arizona'; TRUNCATE TABLE states ; SELECT FROM states WHERE name = '" as an input?
### 4. Cities by states
* Write a script that lists all cities from the database hbtn_0e_4_usa
### 5. All cities by state
* Write a script that takes in the name of a state as an argument and lists all cities of that state, using the database hbtn_0e_4_usa
### 6. First state model
* 
### 7. All states via SQLAlchemy
* Write a script that lists all State objects from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
### 8. First state
* Write a script that prints the first State object from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
### 9. Contains a
* Write a script that lists all State objects that contain the letter a from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
### 10. Get a state
* Write a script that prints the State object with the name passed as argument from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
### 11. Add a new state
* Write a script that adds the State object “Louisiana” to the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
### 12. Update a state
* Write a script that changes the name of a State object from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
### 13. Delete states
* Write a script that deletes all State objects with a name containing the letter a from the database hbtn_0e_6_usa
### 14. Cities in state
* Write a Python file similar to model_state.py named model_city.py that contains the class definition of a City.
### 15. City relationship
* Improve the files model_city.py and model_state.py, and save them as relationship_city.py and relationship_state.py:
### 16. List relationship
* Write a script that lists all State objects, and corresponding City objects, contained in the database hbtn_0e_101_usa
### 17. From city
* Write a script that lists all City objects from the database hbtn_0e_101_usa
